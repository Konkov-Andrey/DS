| **Sentiment Analysis** | `ML for Texts` | The online store is launching a new service. Now, users can edit and supplement product descriptions, similar to wiki communities. In other words, customers can propose their edits and comment on changes made by others. The store needs a tool that will identify toxic comments and submit them for moderation. <a href="https://github.com/Konkov-Andrey/Practicum/blob/main/Machine_Learning_for_Texts/nlp.ipynb">URL</a> |
| **Determining the cost of cars** | `Numerical Methods` | The service for selling used cars is developing an application to attract new customers. You'll be able to find out the market value of your car in it. Build a model that can determine it. You have data on technical specifications, configuration, and prices of other cars at your disposal. The criteria that are important to the customer are: the quality of prediction, the model learning time and the model prediction time. |
| **Taxi Demand Prediction** | `Time Series` | The taxi company has gathered historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak periods, it is necessary to forecast the number of taxi orders for the next hour. <a href="https://github.com/Konkov-Andrey/Practicum/blob/main/Determining_the_cost/cost_of_cars.ipynb">URL</a>|
| **Data Protection** | `Linear Algebra` | It is necessary to protect the data of the insurance company's clients. Develop a method of data transformation that would make it difficult to recover personal information. Justify the correctness of its operation. It is necessary to protect the data so that the quality of machine learning models does not degrade when transforming. |
